    <h3 class="cric">He broke the previous record of fastest fifty in first-class cricket, which was set by Leicestershire’s Wayne White in 12 deliveries against Essex in 2012</h3>
    <h4 class="cric">Meghalaya’s Akash Kumar Choudhary on Sunday (November 9, 2025) became the first player to hit eight sixes in a row in first-class cricket while also recording the fastest half-century in the format, off only 11 deliveries, during a Ranji Trophy Plate Group match against Arunachal Pradesh in Surat. <br>
        Batting at No. 8, 25-year-old Choudhary achieved the stunning feat on the second day of the match at the C.K. Pithawala Ground here. He remained not out on 50 off 14 balls, helping Meghalaya declare their first innings at a mammoth 628 for 6.
        He also became only the third player ever to hit six sixes in a row in first-class cricket after the legendary Sir Garfield Sobers of the West Indies and India’s Ravi Shastri.

Choudhary recorded the feat with Meghalaya cruising at 576 for six. Having started his innings with a dot and two singles, the right-handed batter hit the next eight deliveries for sixes. He sent each of Limar Dabi’s deliveries of the 126th overflying the ropes.

Before Sunday's outing, Choudhary averaged 14.37 with only two fifties in 30 first-class matches, including this year's Duleep Trophy for the North East Zone. He has also played 28 List-A matches and 20 T20 matches.
