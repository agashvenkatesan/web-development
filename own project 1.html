HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the basic structure of a webpage by using various *tags* and *elements* to define content such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and tables. HTML acts as the backbone of any website, allowing web browsers to interpret and display information properly. It works hand in hand with **CSS** (for styling) and **JavaScript** (for interactivity) to build complete and visually appealing web applications. In short, HTML is the foundation of all web content on the internet. <br>

HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is mainly used to create the structure and layout of web pages. It helps in organizing text, images, videos, and links to make web content readable and attractive. HTML allows developers to design web forms for collecting user input, embed multimedia elements, and create hyperlinks that connect different web pages. It is also used to format documents for display in web browsers and to make web pages accessible across different devices. Overall, HTML is essential for building and displaying websites on the internet effectively.
